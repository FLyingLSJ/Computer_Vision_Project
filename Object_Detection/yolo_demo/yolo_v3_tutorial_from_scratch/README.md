YOLO 实现检测的一个 Demo

# YOLO_v3_tutorial_from_scratch

Accompanying code for Paperspace tutorial series ["How to Implement YOLO v3 Object Detector from Scratch"](https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/)

Here's what a typical output of the detector will look like ;)

## About the training Code

This code is only mean't as a companion to the tutorial series and won't be updated. If you want to have a look at the ever updating YOLO v3 code, go to my other repo at https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3

Also, the other repo offers a lot of customisation options, which are not present in this repo for making tutorial easier to follow. (Don't wanna confuse the shit out readers, do we?)

About when is the training code coming? I have my undergraduate thesis this May, and will be busy. So, you might have to wait for a till the second part of May. 

Cheers
